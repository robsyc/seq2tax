# seq2tax
A deep learning-based sequence calssifier applied to 16S rRNA.

This repo builds further on the findings of [my bachelor's project](https://github.com/Lab-Vankerschaver/16S-ML-models) with the goal of creating a highly accurate, easy-to-use and easy-to-interpret sequence classification tool for the 16S rRNA gene but which can be applied and quickly re-trained to any marker gene.
